Presentation Text


Intro to category terms, and how they are terrifying - then think it was similar to when I first started programming, Then say decided to make it about things that I could understand, (slides go from category theory, to categories, to cats)... The title of this talk is let the cats out of the bag. Subtitle - Seriously, they can't breathe in there, someone call a vet.

But cats don't like bags - they like boxes (swith slide to cats in boxes.)

There are certain properties about boxes...


<!-- time passes -->

Later...

Now I'm going to re-tell the same story but change some of the words.

We are going to call the box a computational context. To help understand what I mean by that, I'll give you some concrete examples of the abstraction we are talkinga bout. An array is a computational context. So is a list. So is a maybe. These are all container like things that have certain properties. The properties, are: that they are 'mappable'. We'll also call them functors.
